6. ## [LOAD BALANCER]()

 -   its use to manage the traffic          of any web server or application       by using specified load balancer       type.
  
      
 - **USE CASES**: Load balancers             improve applicationerformance          by increasing response time            and reducing network latency.

      - **types of load balancing:--**
        
   
         - *CLASSIC LOAD BALANCER* :             itS simply used for Ec2                instance load balancing
     
         
         
         - *APPLICATION LOADBALANCER*:          in a single term its used to           balance the traffic of                 application.
         
         
         - *NETWORK LOAD BALANCER* :            The loadbalancer                       distributesincoming traffic            across multiple                        targets, such as                       Amazon EC2 instances. 


 - **Load balancing algorithim**:-A       load balancing algorithm isthe set     of rules that a load balancer          follows to determine the best          server for each of the different       client requests.

  - **Distributed Systems (Clusters)**:-
     a computer system, a cluster is a     group of servers and other             resources that act like a single       system and enable high                 availability, load balancing and       parallel processing.


  - **Scaling**:-  the ability of         organization (or a system, such as     a computer network) to perform well    under an increased or expanding        workload

    
  - **Autoscaling**:- Auto Scaling allows your application to always have the compute capacity needed and reduces the need to manually monitor server capacity.

     *There are two basic types of  scalability in cloud computing: vertical and horizontal scaling.--*

    - Vertical scaling :Vertical             scaling, often known as ‚Äúscaling       up,‚Äù is the process of                 increasing the power of an             existing system,
   
    - Horizontal Scaling :                  "horizontally scalable" system is       one that can increase capacity         by adding more computers to the        system.
